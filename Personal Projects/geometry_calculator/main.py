"""Class Implementation:
Create separate classes for different shapes: Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle
Implement a Square class as a subclass of Rectangle Include appropriate attributes for each shape (e.g., radius, length, width, base, height)
Shape Calculations:
Implement methods to calculate area and perimeter for each shape
Create a method to display all information about a shape Include a static method in each class to explain the formulas used
User Interface:
Design a text-based menu for interacting with the calculator
Allow users to create multiple shapes and switch between them
Include options to perform various calculations on the selected shape
Validation and Error Handling:
Implement input validation to ensure positive values for dimensions Handle potential errors (e.g., division by zero, invalid input types)
Shape Comparisons:
Create methods to compare two shapes (e.g., has_larger_area(), has_longer_perimeter())
Implement a feature to sort multiple shapes based on a chosen property (area or perimeter)
Bonus are only available to projects submitted on time that meet ALL of the minimum requirements.
